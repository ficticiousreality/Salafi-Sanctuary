#### **What is Salafi Sanctuary?**

We are a Salafi/Athari Islamic polemics publication based in Queens, New York City aiming to give da'wah (invitation) to the sunnah and way of Allah and His messenger. We refute pretenses made by Atheists, Christians, Deists, and other than them.

Since I, Abu Unayzah, lack the necessary knowledge to give classes or in-depth explanations myself, this website acts more as a compilation/library of benefits and knowledge from those who are knowledgable, such as the kibar (major) Salafi scholars such as those from the The Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Verdicts, which includes (current members):

- Head: Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh;
- Deputy Head: Shaykh ‘Abdullaah Ibn Ghudayyaan;
- Member: Shaykh ‘Abdullaah Ibn Qu’ood;
- Member: Shaykh ‘Abdullaah Ibn Munee’;
- Member: Shaykh Saalih Ibn Fawzaan.

And also includes the scholars who have passed away: 

- Shaykh Ibraaheem Ibn Muhammad Aal ash-Shaykh;
- Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azeez Ibn Baaz;
- Shaykh ‘Abdur-Razzaaq Ibn ‘Afeefee;
- Shaykh Bakar ‘Abdullaah Abu Zayd.

There are many more major scholars that weren't in the committee, such as Ibn Uthaymeen, Al-Albani, Rabi al-Madkhali, and whoever is with them.

From the English-speaking scholars whose knowledge I intend to propagate:

- Salafi Publications (and those who are with them)
- Germantown Masjid (and those who are with them)
- TROID (and those who are with them)
- DUS Dawah (and those who are with them)
- Masjid Rahmah (and those who are with them)

and whomsoever is connected with any of these.
