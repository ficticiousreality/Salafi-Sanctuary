A Refutation of "Liberal/Progressive Muslims" by Abu Mujahid Nuh al-Kori

*Note by Abu Unayzah Tasmim Akon: This isn't meant to be a general refutation of Atheism/Secularism/Liberalism, rather it is specifically aimed at, and addresses "Progressive/Liberal Muslims", who already believe in Allah and His Messenger. There is no doubt that their beliefs are fallacious, since Liberalism is actually kufr (i.e. disbelief, due to preference for secularism and subjective moral values over Allah's legislated morals and laws.)*
