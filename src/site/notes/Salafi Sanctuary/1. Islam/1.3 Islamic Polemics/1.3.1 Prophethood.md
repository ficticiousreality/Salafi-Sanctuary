Greetings, o Travelers and residents of this world. 

This chapter mainly concerns the historicity of The Prophet, his miracles, character and testimony to those things.

If any rational person were to ponder upon the prophethood of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, they would come to the conclusion that he was indeed a prophet and messenger sent from God. 

The people at the time of Muhammad, even those who were not Muslim, testified to the truthfulness of Muhammad, even calling him "Al-Amin" (The Truthful/Trustworthy One). 

Many non-Muslim scholars and historians have concluded that Muhammad was at least *sincere* and *not a deliberate liar*. Here are some statements from them:

> W. Montgomery Watt states:
> 
> His readiness to undergo persecutions for his beliefs, the high moral character of the men who believed in him and looked up to him as leader, and the greatness of his ultimate achievement - all argue his fundamental integrity.  **To suppose Muhammad an impostor raises more problems than it solves.**  Moreover, none of the great figures of history is so poorly appreciated in the West as Muhammad. **(W. Montgomery Watt, _Mohammad at Mecca_, Oxford 1953, p. 52)** 
> 
> Sir William Muir said:
> 
> It is strongly corroborative of **Mahomet's sincerity** that the earliest converts to Islam were not only of upright character, but his own bosom friends and people of his household; who, intimately acquainted with his private life, could not fail otherwise to have detected those discrepancies which ever more or less exist between the professions of the hypocritical deceiver abroad and his actions at home. **(Sir William Muir, _The Life of Mahomet_, page 54)** 
> 
> And:
> 
> I agree with Sprenger in considering 'the faith of Abu Bakr the greatest guarantee **of the sincerity of Mohammed** in the beginning of his career' - and, indeed, in a modified sense, **throughout his life.** **(Ibid., page 56)**
> 
> J.W.H. Stobart said:
> 
> Abu Bakr was a man of the purest character. His friendship for Mahomet, and unwavering belief in his mission, are a strong testimony **to the sincerity of the prophet.** **(J.W.H. Stobart, _Islam and its Founder_, page 209)**
> 
> Tor Andrae said:
> 
> **The genuineness and sincerity of Mohammed's piety, and the honesty of his belief in his religious call, are indisputable.** **(Tor Andrae, _Mohammed: The Man and his Faith_, page 185)**
> 
> John Gilchrist said:
> 
> **We can safely reject the view that Muhammad was a deliberate impostor.** Throughout the twenty-three year period of his assumed ministry, he held to the unflinching conviction that he was called to be a prophet and that the revelations **he was receiving were coming to him from above.** **(John Gilchrist, _Muhammad and The Religion of Islam_, Chapter: A Study of Muhammad's Personality: An Assessment of His Personality)**
> 
> Arthur Glyn Leonard said:
> 
> If ever a man on this earth found God, if ever a man devoted his life to God's service **with a good and great motive, it is certain that the Prophet of Arabia (Muhammad) is the man.** Muhammad was not only the greatest but truest man that humanity has ever produced. **(Arthur Glyn Leonard,** __**Islam**___, **__her moral and spiritual value__: A Rational and Psychological Study**_**, pages 18-19)**
